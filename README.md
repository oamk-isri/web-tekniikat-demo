# Tooling

Tools used:
```
bootstrap@5.2.3
sass
```

## sass usage
You need local installs of both `bootstrap` and `sass` to generate the `style.css`.

Firstly you should install nodejs for npm via your preferred install method.

Install `bootstrap`
```
$ npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
```

Install `sass` globally
```
# npm install -g sass
```

You can then generate the `style.css` with
```
$ sass [path to style.scss] [path to style.css]
```
